LiveLinkOpenVR plugin is required. 
The official plugin doesn't support finger tracking yet, so you can use my modified version instead. If you don't need finger tracking, omit it.
If you delete your project's plugins folder, you can use the default plugins.

The core of the VR mocap project is the tracker manager, vr actors, and editor widgets.
